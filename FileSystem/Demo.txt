The internet is the most 
recent man-made creation
 that connects the world.
  The world has narrowed down
   after the invention of the internet.
    It has demolished all boundaries, which were the barriers between people and has made everything accessible. The internet is helpful to us in different ways. It is beneficial for sharing information with people in any corner of the world. It is also used in schools, government and private offices, and other public spaces. We stay connected to our close ones and share all the recent and live news with the help of the internet. Sitting in our homes, we know about all thatâ€™s happening around the world with a click or a swipe. The internet gives an answer to almost every question and touches every aspect of our lives.
